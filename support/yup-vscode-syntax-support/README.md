## why make this extension ?

the purpose of this extension ***isn't to fully support the yup language!!*** <br>
this extenstion was created to make it easier to navigate through and read the .yup source files ***during the language's development***.


if you want (and know how to), you can make a better extension yourself and contribute to the repository.
